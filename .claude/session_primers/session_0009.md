# Session 0009 - Git Personas System: Complex SSH Management vs Simplified Local Keys

## Project Development: Advanced Git Persona Implementation
Successfully developed core git-personas system with dynamic identity switching between human and AI within the same repository. Built complete `git-personas.zsh` script with safety hooks using `GP_HUMAN_SESSION` environment variable detection, comprehensive testing functions (`persona_ai()`, `persona_human()`, `persona_who()`, `persona_test_human/ai`), and debugging utilities (`check-all-ssh-keys`, YubiKey conflict resolution). The system demonstrates working identity management, commit attribution, and safety mechanisms to prevent humans from accidentally committing as AI persona.

## SSH Transport Complexity and Git Design Limitations
Attempted complex SSH transport using YubiKey (human) and KeePassXC via Windows pageant bridge (AI), but discovered git's static configuration assumptions conflict with dynamic SSH socket management. SSH agent restarts constantly invalidate hardcoded socket paths in git config, creating reliability issues. The `core.sshCommand` approach requires complex environment variable management and creates ongoing maintenance burden. Git's single-user design assumptions make this architecture fragile despite technical feasibility.

## Simplified Future Path: Local AI Keys with Cached Passphrases
Identified much simpler alternative approach: retain the working git-personas identity/safety system but eliminate complex SSH socket switching. AI persona would use locally stored private SSH keys with passphrase caching for automation, while human persona continues using YubiKey keys as system default. This approach keeps all benefits (clear attribution, safety hooks, identity management) while removing problematic dynamic SSH configuration. Trade-off of local AI key storage is acceptable given passphrase protection and time-limited caching.

## Next Steps
Current system provides solid foundation with working identity switching and safety mechanisms. Future implementation should focus on simplified SSH transport using local AI keys rather than complex agent socket management. Alternative fallback remains the proven metadata attribution approach with `provenance.yml` for GitHub operations.
