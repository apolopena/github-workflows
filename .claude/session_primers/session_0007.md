# Session 0007 - Git-Personas Final Implementation & Wrapping Challenges

## Completed Core Functionality & Documentation
Successfully completed the git-personas system implementation with all essential features working. The script now resides in `scripts/git-personas.zsh` with clear user configuration sections and comprehensive README documentation. Key achievements include removing the persona state file (eliminating home directory clutter), fixing `persona_who` to work outside git repositories, adding user configuration blocks with clear instructions, and creating complete installation examples for both zsh and bash users. The system provides transparent AI/human attribution through git identity and signing, with CLAUDE.md integration for AI usage patterns and comprehensive troubleshooting documentation.

## Git Wrapping Safety Implementation Challenges
Encountered significant technical challenges implementing automatic human safety checks due to git function wrapping complexity. The script attempts to override the `git` command with `_human_safety_check` for interactive shells, but faces multiple issues: alias conflicts with existing user git aliases, infinite recursion when `ENABLE_SAFETY_CHECK=false` (line 29: `git "$@"` should be `command git "$@"`), and sourcing order dependencies requiring git-personas to load after existing aliases. These challenges demonstrate why git command wrapping is inherently problematic and fragile across different user environments and shell configurations.

## Architecture Decisions & Token Efficiency Analysis
Maintained the hybrid approach with AI persona using KeePassXC keys via pageant bridge and HUMAN persona using existing SSH config with GPG signing. Token consumption analysis confirmed shell script approach provides 50-100x better efficiency than proposed MCP server alternative (~18 tokens vs 500+ per operation). The system successfully integrates with both provenance.yml workflows for GitHub operations and direct git operations for development work. Documentation structured to be generic and implementation-agnostic, focusing on git persona functionality rather than specific hardware/software requirements.

## Next Steps & Outstanding Issues
Primary remaining issue is resolving the git function wrapping infinite recursion bug (line 29 needs `command git "$@"`). Alternative approach may be abandoning automatic git wrapping entirely in favor of clear documentation for manual safety setup, eliminating alias conflicts and sourcing order dependencies. Once resolved, the system is ready for production testing with both AI and human personas in real development workflows. Consider updating MCP server specification reference based on lessons learned about shell integration complexity.
