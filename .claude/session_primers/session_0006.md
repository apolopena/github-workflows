# Session 0006 - git-personas Optimization & Safety Implementation

## Completed Work: Full git-personas Workflow Success
Successfully debugged and implemented a complete git-personas system for transparent AI/human git collaboration. The workflow uses separate SSH keys for AI (stored in KeePassXC via Windows Pageant bridge) and HUMAN (YubiKey via direct PKCS#11) personas. Key achievements include fixing the pageant bridge connectivity (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` issues), configuring GitHub SSH keys (AUTH for transport, SIGN for verification), adding apolopena-AI as repository collaborator, and validating end-to-end functionality. The system now supports proper attribution through git identity and SSH signing without cluttering commit messages.

## Technical Architecture & Discovery
The solution operates across Windows/WSL2 boundary using KeePassXC → Pageant → wsl2-ssh-pageant bridge for AI keys, while HUMAN persona uses existing SSH config with YubiKey PKCS#11 and GPG signing (SSH signing removed due to WSL incompatibility). Critical finding: Claude Code shell environment uses snapshots rather than live .zshrc sourcing, requiring the pattern `source script.zsh && function_name` in single commands. Token consumption analysis revealed that script size/comments don't affect tokens (only sourcing command ~10 tokens + output ~8 tokens = ~18 tokens total), making documentation in scripts cost-free.

## MCP Server Analysis & Future Direction
Designed comprehensive MCP server specification for broader git-personas management but determined current shell script approach is optimal. MCP server would consume 50-100x more tokens (500-1500+ per session vs 18 for shell script) and targets extremely niche use case (Windows/WSL2/YubiKey/KeePassXC intersection). Created optimized git-personas script with safety features: auto-expiring AI persona (10-minute timeout), state tracking, commit confirmation prompts, and visual indicators to prevent accidental human commits as AI persona.

## Next Steps
The git-personas system is production-ready with the optimized script at `.claude/git-personas-optimized.zsh`. Future enhancements could include testing the optional git alias override for additional safety, expanding to support multiple AI/human account configurations, or reconsidering MCP server development if the workflow gains broader adoption beyond the current specialized Windows/WSL2/hardware security key environment.
