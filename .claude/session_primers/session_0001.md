# Session Primer 0002

## Current Work Overview

We completed a comprehensive enhancement of the GitHub workflows provenance system, implementing conditional HTML blockquote formatting that differentiates between AI and human labels. AI labels receive full provenance blocks with "Generated by" and "Initiated by" fields plus AI-PROVENANCE comments, while human labels get simplified blocks with only "Initiated by" and no AI comment markers. We successfully resolved critical positioning and formatting issues by moving provenance blocks to the bottom of content and implementing `printf '%b'` to convert literal `\n` characters to actual line breaks for proper GitHub markdown rendering.

## Key Implementation Decisions

The project architecture was streamlined by consolidating the redundant `provenance-test.yml` into the main `provenance.yml` workflow, adding both `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch` triggers to eliminate code duplication while preserving GUI testing capabilities. We established comprehensive development guidelines in `.claude/guides/` including git attribution patterns, workflow testing procedures, and the critical rule that all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, comments) must use the provenance workflow rather than direct `gh` commands. All changes were successfully tested, code-reviewed, and merged into the `provenance_label` branch with proper Claude attribution and provenance tracking.

## Documentation and Infrastructure

We created a structured `.claude/guides/` system with DEVELOPMENT.md, GIT.md, and SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md that serves as permanent institutional knowledge for the project. The session management framework distinguishes between session primers (temporary context recovery for incomplete work) and development guides (permanent foundational principles), with the key insight that "session primers are for continuity, guides are for competency." The gitignore was updated to track these guides while excluding local settings, ensuring the knowledge base persists across sessions.

## Status and Next Steps

All current work is complete and merged. The enhanced provenance system is fully operational with improved visual presentation and proper attribution tracking. Future work would benefit from reading the development guides first to understand established patterns, with session primers only needed if continuing incomplete multi-session tasks.
